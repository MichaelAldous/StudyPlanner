    <string name="disclaimer_def">The DPM App is a Prototype version of a degree planner only and
        NOT an official study plan. It is intended that students shall use this to get an
        understanding of the pathways offered and then discuss study plans with a Wintec
        representative. Pathways may change accordingly making older versions redundant â€“ Wintec
        takes no responsibility of outdated pathways or information displayed on the app.</string>
